Data Consistency and Convergence in Distributed Systems


In this project, the key research paper that we've reviewed is “Putting consistency back into Eventual consistency”. This paper along with the related supporting papers suggests new approaches to solve the data consistency and convergence problems in an operational distributed systems model. By reviewing these papers we try to prove that it is not necessary to give up data integrity and convergence for achieving low-latency and high throughput.
